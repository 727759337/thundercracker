Doxygen documentation
======================
- Intended to be main developer-facing documentation for the Sifteo SDK
- Requires at least doxygen 1.8.0, as we're using markdown format for most documentation
- Doxygen/Markdown reference: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/markdown.html
- Add new documents to docs/doxygen/src with .md suffix - they will be automatically included in the docs build
- docs/doxygen/html is where auto docs get generated - this is gitigore'd, please don't check any of this in
