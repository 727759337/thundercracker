# Games and Example Code

Games you produce using the Sifteo SDK are not subject to this license. You wrote the code, you own the binaries too.

Header files and example code included with the SDK are free to use for any purpose. You wouldn't expect any less, right?

Some examples include artwork which is distributed under its own license. See individual LICENSE.txt files where applicable.

# Open Source Software

The Sifteo SDK wouldn't be what it is today without these awesome open source projects! The licenses and descriptions below refer to individual open source projects that are distributed with the SDK directly, or which are compiled into our SDK tools.

## [LLVM](http://llvm.org) and [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org)

The compiler we ship in the SDK is an unmodified build of Clang. Slinky stands on the shoulders of giants, taking advantage of LLVM's fantastic optimizer and code generator framework.
