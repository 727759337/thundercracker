Asset Workflow      {#asset_workflow}
==============

@b stir is a tool that formats your visual and audio assets to the compact formats used on Sifteo Cubes. It accepts configuration files written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org), and generates C++ code that should be built into your project.

Proofs of your image assets are also generated, so you can easily inspect them after the formatting process.

# Overview

@b stir is driven by a config file within your project written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org), typically named `assets.lua`. Don't worry if you're not familiar with Lua - the simplest stir configurations are essentially declarative lists of assets, and you can easily adapt the SDK examples to fit your needs.

# Asset Images

Let's look at a basic assets.lua config dealing with images only:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
GameAssets = group{}

Background = image{"stars-bg.png", quality=9.85}
Star = image{"star-8.png", pinned=true, width=8, height=8}
Font = image{"font-8x16.png", pinned=true, width=8, height=16}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The @b group element specifies that a Sifteo::AssetGroup named `GameAssets` should be created. This group contains all the `image` entries that follow it, until another `group` is declared. You can also explicitly specify the group that an `image` belongs to by adding `group=MyGroupName` within the `image` element. An AssetGroup is the unit of get installed to Sifteo Cubes at the same time, so you should typically keep related images in the same group.

Each @b image element specifies that an AssetImage should be generated. Given no other details, a plain Sifteo::AssetImage will be generated, as in the case of @b Background above. By adding `pinned=true`, a Sifteo::PinnedAssetImage is created. Pinned assets are required for sprites, since the Sifteo platform requires all tiles in a sprite to be sequential.

By default, images are compressed to save room in your game's binary. However, if you need random access to your image data from within your game, you can specify `flat=1` within your `image` element, and @b stir will create a Sifteo::FlatAssetImage instead - a larger, uncompressed version of your image. For example: `Background = image{"stars-bg.png", flat=true}`

## Color

No guarantees are made about the specific RGB color space for source images, since the LCD on each Sifteo Cube is not color-calibrated and colors can vary significantly with changes in viewing angle.

Stir does not perform any colorspace conversion other than rounding each pixel to the nearest 16-bit RGB565 color. However, the compression process needs to evaluate the perceptibility of every individual lossy operation that could be performed, to decide which transforms would be too lossy given the current quality level. These perceptual comparisons are made in the linear CIELAB color space, after converting from an approximated sRGB colorspace with a single gamma of 2.2.

## Quality

Images are compressed more or less aggressively based on their `quality` parameter. Quality can be any real number from 1 to 10, with 10 meaning lossless, and lower values giving @b stir more freedom to compress.

All images within a Sifteo::AssetGroup can share tiles, and if @b stir determines that tiles within different images are similar enough, it can create a single tile to be shared by the 2 images, reducing the overall size of your application's installation. Of course, if the quality setting is too high, @b stir cannot take these liberties and your application will be larger as a result.

Compression is a very important part of keeping your asset budget under control. Dial down the quality for your images as much as you can stand and applications will be smaller, asset installation times will be shorter, and the world will be a better place.

Quality is continuously variable. Don't be shy about using a quality value like 9.998 if that's what looks best for your assets. Avoid using a quality of 10 unless it's vital that the assets are completely lossless. Lossless compression will often result in many tiles which have no visible differences.

## Frames

If you omit `width` and `height` attributes for your image elements, @b stir will default to creating AssetImages with the native width and height of your source image, in a single frame.

Animations consisting of multiple frames should lay out each frame contiguously in the source image. You can then specify `width` or `height` to indicate the size of a frame within your image. In this case, @b stir will divide your image into a grid of appropriately sized frames, and its `frames` attribute will be calculated accordingly from left to right, top to bottom.

@note If you're creating a long animation which may have many duplicated frames in it, stir will automatically factor out these duplicated frames assuming the asset is not marked as `flat` or `pinned`. The _Dictionary Uniform Block (DUB)_ codec operates on blocks of up to 8x8 tiles within each frame. If any 8x8 tile blocks are identical, they will all be represented by the same data in memory.

## Image Option Summary

Option              | Meaning
-------             | -------------
`quality=N`         | Set the quality of this image to `N`, where N is a number between 1 and 10
`pinned=true`       | Create a Sifteo::PinnedAssetImage
`flat=true`         | Create a Sifteo::FlatAssetImage
`width=8`           | Specify the width of a frame in your image, defaults to source image's native width.
`height=16`         | Specify the height of a frame of your image, defaults to source image's native height.
`group=MyGroup`     | Specify that this image is a member of the `group` element `MyGroup`

# Asset Image Lists

It is occasionally desirable to export images as an array.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
Environments = group{}

TileSets = { image{"desert.png"}, image{"ocean.png"}, image{"castle.png"} }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image Lists must contain only images, or else they are ignored.  Furthermore, the images must be homogeneous: you may not interleave pinned, flat and ordinary assets in the same list.

Asset Image Lists are just a way of grouping together several distinct AssetImage instances. This can be handy when you have several images which are related, but may have different dimensions or compression formats, or when each image already contains multiple frames.

Note that this syntax is distinct from the following, which creates a single Sifteo::AssetImage with two frames by passing an array of PNG filenames to the image constructor:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
Sprites = group{}

PlayerSprite = image{ { "player-sitting.png", "player-standing.png"}, pinned=true }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@note If you have the choice between using a single Asset Image with multiple frames, instead of an Asset Image List, the single Asset Image can be more efficient.

# Asset Audio

## Samples

## Tracker

Here's an assets.lua containing two modules:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
Bubbles = tracker{"bubbles.xm"}
Slumberjack = tracker{"slumberjack.xm"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each @b tracker element specifies that an AssetTracker module should be generated. No further configuration is available for tracker modules.

### Input

Stir will accept (and the cubes will attempt to play) almost any XM module, so long as some limitations (below) are met. It's recommended that you use [MilkyTracker](http://www.milkytracker.org) or [MODPlug](http://www.modplug.com/trackerinfo.html) as your authoring tool, as the Sifteo tracker is being designed to emulate them as closely as possible.

### Output

Stir compresses modules in a few ways. All samples (accepted formats: pcm16, pcm8, and adpcm) are compressed to adpcm (like normal AssetSamples), and envelopes are also compressed. In the future, stir/clang will deduplicate samples so multiple songs can share the same sample data, further saving space on the Base.

### Limitations

Due to hardware limitations, modules face a few hard constraints:

* __Panning__ is not available. Any panning information is discarded.
* Songs may not use more than __8 channels__.

Beyond these constraints, modules on Sifteo Cubes are also currently limited to:

* No empty instruments
* No empty patterns
* One sample per instrument

These limitations may be removed with a future version of the asset toolchain, but it should be possible to work around them in the meantime.

### Effects

The included tracker implements most of the effects available in XM modules. The following standard effects are not yet available:

* Automatic instrument vibrato

The following effects are not implemented, and likely inconsistent between MilkyTracker, FastTracker II, and MODPlug, and will not be available:

* Set gliss control (E3)
* Set tremolo control (E7)

All other effects and all volume column effects are implemented.

`-h`                    | Show a help message and exit
`-v`                    | Enable verbose output
`-o <myproof>.html`     | Writes an HTML image proof to `myproof.html` - open this up in your web browser
`-o <assets.gen>.cpp`   | Generates C++ source data for your assets to `<assets.gen>.cpp` - include this file in your build
`-o <assets.gen>.h`     | Generates C++ header data for your assets to `<assets.gen>.h` - include this file in your build
`VAR=VALUE`             | Define a Lua script variable, prior to parsing the script
