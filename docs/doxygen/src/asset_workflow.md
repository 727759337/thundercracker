Asset Workflow      {#asset_workflow}
==============

@b stir is a tool that formats your visual and audio assets to the compact formats used on Sifteo Cubes. It accepts configuration files written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org), and generates C++ code that should be built into your project.

Proofs of your image assets are also generated, so you can easily inspect them after the formatting process.

# Overview

@b stir is driven by a config file within your project written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org), typically named `assets.lua`. Don't worry if you're not familiar with Lua - the simplest stir configurations are essentially declarative lists of assets, and you can easily adapt the SDK examples to fit your needs.

# Asset Images

Let's look at a basic assets.lua config dealing with images only:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
GameAssets = group{}

Background = image{"stars-bg.png", quality=9.85}
Star = image{"star-8.png", pinned=true, width=8, height=8}
Font = image{"font-8x16.png", pinned=true, width=8, height=16}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The @b group element specifies that a Sifteo::AssetGroup named `GameAssets` should be created. This group contains all the `image` entries that follow it, until another `group` is declared. You can also explicitly specify the group that an `image` belongs to by adding `group=MyGroupName` within the `image` element.

All images in a single _group_ are compressed together, and form a bundle of compressed asset data which is loaded to the Sifteo Cubes in one piece. For more information on AssetGroups, see @ref asset_memory.

Each @b image element specifies that an AssetImage should be generated. Given no other details, a plain Sifteo::AssetImage will be generated, as in the case of @b Background above. By adding `pinned=true`, a Sifteo::PinnedAssetImage is created. Pinned assets are required for sprites, since the Sifteo platform requires all tiles in a sprite to be sequential.

By default, images are compressed to save room in your game's binary. However, if you need random access to your image data from within your game, you can specify `flat=1` within your `image` element, and @b stir will create a Sifteo::FlatAssetImage instead - a larger, uncompressed version of your image. For example: `Background = image{"stars-bg.png", flat=true}`

## Color

No guarantees are made about the specific RGB color space for source images, since the LCD on each Sifteo Cube is not color-calibrated and colors can vary significantly with changes in viewing angle.

Stir does not perform any colorspace conversion other than rounding each pixel to the nearest 16-bit RGB565 color. However, the compression process needs to evaluate the perceptibility of every individual lossy operation that could be performed, to decide which transforms would be too lossy given the current quality level. These perceptual comparisons are made in the linear CIELAB color space, after converting from an approximated sRGB colorspace with a single gamma of 2.2.

## Quality

Images are compressed more or less aggressively based on their `quality` parameter. Quality can be any real number from 1 to 10, with 10 meaning lossless, and lower values giving @b stir more freedom to compress.

All images within a Sifteo::AssetGroup can share tiles, and if @b stir determines that tiles within different images are similar enough, it can create a single tile to be shared by the 2 images, reducing the overall size of your application's installation. Of course, if the quality setting is too high, @b stir cannot take these liberties and your application will be larger as a result.

Compression is a very important part of keeping your asset budget under control. Dial down the quality for your images as much as you can stand and applications will be smaller, asset installation times will be shorter, and the world will be a better place.

Quality is continuously variable. Don't be shy about using a quality value like 9.998 if that's what looks best for your assets. Avoid using a quality of 10 unless it's vital that the assets are completely lossless. Lossless compression will often result in many tiles which have no visible differences.

## Frames

If you omit `width` and `height` attributes for your image elements, @b stir will default to creating AssetImages with the native width and height of your source image, in a single frame.

Animations consisting of multiple frames should lay out each frame contiguously in the source image. You can then specify `width` or `height` to indicate the size of a frame within your image. In this case, @b stir will divide your image into a grid of appropriately sized frames, and its `frames` attribute will be calculated accordingly from left to right, top to bottom.

@note If you're creating a long animation which may have many duplicated frames in it, stir will automatically factor out these duplicated frames assuming the asset is not marked as `flat` or `pinned`. The _Dictionary Uniform Block (DUB)_ codec operates on blocks of up to 8x8 tiles within each frame. If any 8x8 tile blocks are identical, they will all be represented by the same data in memory.

## Image Option Summary

Option              | Meaning
-------             | -------------
`quality=N`         | Set the quality of this image to `N`, where N is a number between 1 and 10
`pinned=true`       | Create a Sifteo::PinnedAssetImage
`flat=true`         | Create a Sifteo::FlatAssetImage
`width=8`           | Specify the width of a frame in your image, defaults to source image's native width.
`height=16`         | Specify the height of a frame of your image, defaults to source image's native height.
`group=MyGroup`     | Specify that this image is a member of the `group` element `MyGroup`

# Asset Image Lists

It is occasionally desirable to export images as an array.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
Environments = group{}

TileSets = { image{"desert.png"}, image{"ocean.png"}, image{"castle.png"} }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image Lists must contain only images, or else they are ignored.  Furthermore, the images must be homogeneous: you may not interleave pinned, flat and ordinary assets in the same list.

Asset Image Lists are just a way of grouping together several distinct AssetImage instances. This can be handy when you have several images which are related, but may have different dimensions or compression formats, or when each image already contains multiple frames.

Note that this syntax is distinct from the following, which creates a single Sifteo::AssetImage with two frames by passing an array of PNG filenames to the image constructor:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
Sprites = group{}

PlayerSprite = image{ { "player-sitting.png", "player-standing.png"}, pinned=true }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@note If you have the choice between using a single Asset Image with multiple frames, instead of an Asset Image List, the single Asset Image can be more efficient.

# Asset Audio

## Samples

## Tracker

Here's an assets.lua containing two modules:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.lua}
Bubbles = tracker{"bubbles.xm"}
Slumberjack = tracker{"slumberjack.xm"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each @b tracker element specifies that an AssetTracker module should be generated. No further configuration is available for tracker modules.

### Input

Stir will accept (and the cubes will attempt to play) almost any XM module, so long as some limitations (below) are met. It's recommended that you use [MilkyTracker](http://www.milkytracker.org) or [MODPlug](http://www.modplug.com/trackerinfo.html) as your authoring tool, as the Sifteo tracker is being designed to emulate them as closely as possible.

### Output

Stir compresses modules in a few ways. All samples (accepted formats: pcm16, pcm8, and adpcm) are compressed to adpcm (like normal AssetSamples), and envelopes are also compressed. In the future, stir/clang will deduplicate samples so multiple songs can share the same sample data, further saving space on the Base.

### Limitations

Due to hardware limitations, modules face a few hard constraints:

* __Panning__ is not available. Any panning information is discarded.
* Songs may not use more than __8 channels__.

Beyond these constraints, modules on Sifteo Cubes are also currently limited to:

* No empty instruments
* No empty patterns
* One sample per instrument

These limitations may be removed with a future version of the asset toolchain, but it should be possible to work around them in the meantime.

### Effects

The included tracker implements most of the effects available in XM modules. The following standard effects are not yet available:

* Automatic instrument vibrato

The following effects are not implemented, and likely inconsistent between MilkyTracker, FastTracker II, and MODPlug, and will not be available:

* Set gliss control (E3)
* Set tremolo control (E7)

All other effects and all volume column effects are implemented.

### Performance

Modules can be a very efficient format, but they can also be terrifically inefficient if abused. Here are some tips to keeping your module tight and fast.

#### Samples

Stir compresses samples down to adpcm (just as it does to normal audio samples), but often a composer can save more space and extract more performance by keeping a few things in mind:

* Samples in XM are traditionally 8363 Hz at C-4. This provides a wide range of timbre options while providing a compact sample. The instrument's Relative Note changes the sampling rate by a constant amount, so that an instrument with a higher Relative Note will sample it's audio much faster than an instrument with a lower Relative Note. Higher sampling rates mean higher-quality samples, but also more storage space required in flash, and more flash bus usage during playback. Samples with a Relative Note greater than 0 should be carefully scrutinized. Usually they indicate a 44.1kHz sample that was imported directly into the tracker without resampling.
* The adpcm encoding does not support random access, and it is also monotonic. To support ping pong loops on the Base, Stir converts the ping pong loop into a linear loop, doubling the loop's size. While ping pong loops can be incredibly useful, they can take up significantly more space in flash and should be used sparingly.
* Samples containing empty space are samples that are wasting space. Many samples lead in with some silence or lead out with a long fade. Consider using effect ED (Note delay) instead of leading a sample with silence, and trimming the silence from the end of your sample to save space in flash.
* If you're feeling particularly frugal: if an instrument is only played in the higher registers, it's beneficial to use a lower Relative Note. The Base mixes at 16kHz, so an instrument with a Relative Note of 0 playing a C-5 will be mixing very near the mixer's native rate. Higher notes will be oversampled, wasting flash bandwidth.

#### Effects

Practically all XM features are supported by the tracker. If you find one that's not and would like to make use of it, please report it.

Unfortunately, this does not mean that all XM features will run well on the Base. Due to the unique constraints of our hardware, certain features should be avoided when possible. They are:

9xx: Sample offset
Samples on the Base do not support random access, so jumping to an offset in a sample requires fetching the rest of the sample before the offset as well. In cases where the offset is large and the effect is used on multiple channels at the same time, this can noticeably affect your game's performance.

Dxx: Pattern break
Patterns, like samples, do not support random access and must be read from the beginning of the pattern to the requested offset. As such, executing a pattern break and jumping more than a few rows into the next pattern can be expensive.

E6x: Pattern loop
It is possible to use pattern loops in an efficient manner, but due to the linear access nature of patterns they can also be very inefficient. Where possible, pattern loops should start as near to the beginning of the pattern as possible—looping to the very beginning of a pattern is as cheap as stepping to the next row in the same pattern.

The least efficient pattern loop would begin the loop on the second to last row of the pattern, with a duration of one row. This would cause the entire pattern to be read from flash on every loop division.

#### Channels

The Base Cube supports 8 channels of audio, and all of them can be used for tracker playback, but before creating a song using all 8 channels, there are a few reasons why fewer is better:

* Channels being used to play your song are channels that are not available to be used for sound effects. A song with 8 channels leaves you with no free channels for dynamic sound effects when a user interacts with your game.
* Patterns are the second largest consumers of flash after samples (potentially the largest, if you're taking advantage of sample deduplication across modules), and their size increases linearly with the number of channels.

Lastly, editing tools do not appear to have a way to add or remove channels after a song has been created. While stir should handle this in the future, it does not today and your songs will be larger and have the potential to conflict with standard sound effects. To mitigate this, the tracker allocates channels from the top down in the mixer, so a song that has eight channels but only uses channels one through four (trackers like to one-index their numbering) will leave channels zero through three (whereas we use zero-indexing) free on the Base.
