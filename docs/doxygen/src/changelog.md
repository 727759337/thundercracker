* `swiss savedata delete` can be used to remove just the save data for a particular game. See @ref device_mgmt for details.

# v1.0.0 (March 27, 2013)

### New
* LOG() now works on hardware as well as the siftulator. Use `swiss listen` to access the log output - see @ref device_mgmt for details.

* added attribute getters for Sifteo::AssetTracker - bpm(), numChannels(), numIntruments(), numPatterns(), and tempo()
