# Overview              {#overview}

`swiss` is a utility tool, provided with the SDK to perform a variety of device management tasks. `swiss` can be found in __sdk/bin__ within the Sifteo SDK.

You can easily use `swiss` from within an SDK shell - just double click on the appropriate launcher in the SDK:
* Windows: double click `sifteo-sdk-shell.cmd`
* Mac OS X: double click `sifteo-sdk-shell.command`
* Linux: run `sifteo-sdk-shell.sh`

# Install Apps          {#install}

To install a new version of your application to your Sifteo base, use the `swiss install` command as follows:

    swiss install myapplication.elf

This will remove any previously installed versions of `myapplication.elf`, and install the new one. There is currently no restriction on installing a new version while your application is running, but it's not guaranteed to work, and not recommended!

To install an app that should be used as the launcher menu, use the `-l` flag:

    swiss install -l mylauncher.elf

@note You must call Sifteo::Metadata::package() within your game's source code in order to generate the information required to install it successfully.

# Manifest              {#manifest}

The `manifest` command provides a summary of the content installed on your Sifteo base. Invoke it with:

    swiss manifest

Depending on what you have installed, you'll see some results similar to those below:

    C:\code\sifteo-sdk\examples>swiss manifest
    System: 128 kB  Free: 15104 kB  Firmware:
    VOL TYPE     ELF-KB OBJ-KB PACKAGE               VERSION TITLE
    01  Launcher    128      0 (none)                (none)  (none)
    10  Game        128      0 com.sifteo.extras.hello 0.1     Hello World SDK Example

# Delete Content        {#delete}

Swiss provides a few options for removing content from your Sifteo base. To remove all content from your Sifteo base, use the `--all` flag:

    swiss delete --all

To remove a single game, remove delete it by specifying its __volume__.

You can retrieve the volume number of a game from the `manifest` command above. For example, in the manifest output above the "Hello World SDK Example" is listed as __10__ in the __VOL__ column, so the command to remove it is:

    swiss delete volume 10

You can also remove all system bookkeeping information from the base, including Sifteo::AssetSlot allocation records.

    swiss delete --sys

Once you delete this system info, the base will need to install assets to your cubes the next time you play a game, even if those assets were previously installed.

# Update Firmware       {#fwupdate}

Swiss can also update the firmware on your Sifteo base. This is a two step process. First, initialize the updater on the base:

    swiss update --init

This should cause your base to disconnect from USB and reboot into the updater. Once this has happened, you can install the new firmware:

    swiss update myNewFirmware.sft

The red LED on the base will be illuminated during the update, and will turn off once the update is complete.

If you need to force an update, you can use the following recovery process:
* remove batteries from the base and disconnect from USB
* hold down the home button on the base
* connect the base via USB (this will turn on the base)
* continue holding down the home button on the base for one second

After one second, the red LED illuminates and you can proceed with the normal update process as above.
