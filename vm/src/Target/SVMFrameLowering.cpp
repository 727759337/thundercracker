 * but that makes argument passing a lot hairier than it needs to be!
 *
 * So, until we have a good reason to do otherwise, we'll just claim to
 * LLVM that our stack grows upwards. What it doesn't know won't hurt it?
 *
 * Also, we always want the stack to be 4-byte aligned, but in SVM we have
 * no need for 8-byte alignment. SVM doesn't support any instructions that

     * Apply a stack frame adjustment at the beginning of this function.
     * On SVM, there are three ways to do this. In order of decreasing
     * preferability:
     *
     *   1. We can get a small adjustment (0x7F words or less) for
     *      free as part of the 'call' SVC. This stack adjustment is encoded
     *      into the function address at link time, using a FNSTACK
     *      pseudo-instruction, which is used by SVMELFProgramWriter to
     *      generate the proper relocations.
     *
     *   2. Small remainders can be allocated using SPADJ. This works for
     *      up to 31 words at a time.
     *
     *   3. Larger remainders are allocated using an indirect addrop which
     *      can allocate up to 64MB of stack space :)
     *
     * The addrop in (3) clearly trumps the other two methods for dealing
     * with truly large stack frames. But because the FNSTACK adjustment is
     * so cheap, we always try to use it. This also has the nice effect of
     * making large-stacked functions clearly visible, since they'll have
     * a 0x7F in their upper address bits.
