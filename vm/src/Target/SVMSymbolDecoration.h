/*
 * Magic symbol prefixes.
 *
 * These are used as an ad-hoc way of passing annotations to the
 * "linker" in SVMELFProgramWriter. We have some very nonstandard
 * features in the SVM architecture: syscalls that look like functions,
 * function calls and tail calls that encode the instruction op into
 * the target pointer, etc.
 *
 * Since LLVM has no native way to represent these types cleanly, as
 * far as I'm aware, this approach lets us pass custom info to our
 * linker without patching the LLVM core.
