Sifteo TC Virtual Machine (SVM)
===============================


What is it?
-----------

 - Like Native Client, but for small-memory microcontrollers
 - A paravirtualization environment
 - A language VM that happens to be partially Thumb-compatible
 - A safe Direct Execution environment for untrusted code
 - A hardware-assisted sandboxing interpreter


Memory Protection
-----------------

The register file is divided into a trusted portion (r8-r15) and an untrusted
portion (r0-r7). Trusted registers cannot be directly modified by valid VM
instructions, whereas untrusted registers can be modified arbitrarily.

Register r8 is used as a read only base (BRO) and r9 is used as a read/write
base address (BRW). The set of valid VM instructions includes instructions:

  ldr   rN, r8, #imm12
  ldrh  rN, r8, #imm12
  ldrb  rN, r8, #imm12
  ldrsh rN, r8, #imm12
  ldrsb rN, r8, #imm12

  ldr   rN, r9, #imm12
  ldrh  rN, r9, #imm12
  ldrb  rN, r9, #imm12
  ldrsh rN, r9, #imm12
  ldrsb rN, r9, #imm12
  
  str   rN, r9, #imm12
  strh  rN, r9, #imm12
  strb  rN, r9, #imm12

The two base registers may be updated using a SVC which copies any r0-r7
to r8-r9 after performing address translation and validation.

Virtual memory map:

  00000000 - 0000FFFF     1. Invalid (guard region to catch NULL pointers)
  00010000 - 00017FFF     2. 32 kB of user RAM for stack and data
  00018000 - 7FFFFFFF     3. Invalid
  80000000 - FFFFFFFF     4. External data (Flash) virtual address space

Sample physical memory map:

  00000000 - 1FFFFFFF     A. System code space
  20000000 - 20003FFF     B. 16 kB system data space
  20004000 - 20007FFF     C. 16 kB flash memory cache
  20008000 - 2000FFFF     D. 32 kB user data space
  20010000 - 21FFFFFF     E. Unimplemented in hardware, causes trap
  
Region (1) is guaranteed to fault on read or write. A NULL pointer plus any
imm12 will land in this region. Any invalid pointers will fault on load/store,
not on validate, so that the fault occurs only at actual time of use.

Address translation for regions (1-3) can be performed using:

  physical = ((virtual - 0x10000) & 0xFFFFF) + 0x20008000

Region (3) is not guaranteed to fault. Some invalid user pointers will
silently alias to other valid user RAM addresses. Example virtual to physical
translations:

  00000000 -> 200F8000    Invalid, causes trap
  0000FFFF -> 20107FFF    Invalid, causes trap
  00010000 -> 20008000    First byte in user RAM
  00017FFF -> 2000FFFF    Last byte in user RAM
  00018000 -> 20010000    Invalid, causes trap
  0001FFFF -> 20017FFF    Invalid, causes trap
  000FFFFF -> 200F7FFF    Invalid, causes trap
  00110000 -> 20008000    Invalid, causes aliasing
  FFFFFFFF -> 200F7FFF    Invalid, causes trap

The validate SVCs are responsible for detecting addresses in region (4) and
routing them through the system's flash cache. Userspace code may 'check out'
a flash page in this manner. The pointer saved to r8-r9 will be to a temporary
copy of the flash page, in region (C). The page is only guaranteed to stay at
that address until the next SVC. This means that function calls, long jumps,
and other validate SVCs will invalidate the contents of r8-r9.

By placing the cache region (C) immediately prior to user data region (D), we
can make out-of-range imm12 values harmless. The worst that a malicious or
buggy app can do is to read user data or other cache pages, both of which it
could already access. For the same reason, thehis also means we can allow
literal pool loads without checking the immediate.

The flash memory cache (C) is always treated as a read-only region in this
scheme. Actual writes to flash, e.g. for saved game data, must be performed
using special-purpose system calls. This simplifies the design, as well as
adding a layer of protection against inadvertent writes.


Instruction Set Architecture
----------------------------

The SVM architecture uses a reduced subset of Thumb-2, which contains only
operations which are always safe for unprivileged code to perform.

Most importantly, the architecture is designed such that any page of code can
be quickly validated, at load time, to determine which portion of the page
contains valid instructions. Any page can be divided into a data portion at
the end, and a code portion at the beginning. By walking the page from
beginning to end, at load time we determine the highest address that
represents valid code. This final instruction must be an unconditional near or
far branch.

This address is saved in a look-aside buffer, for validating SVC-assisted
calls and far branches. Near branches are validated at load time, in a second
pass.

In order to support the use of 32-bit Thumb-2 instructions without
overcomplicating the validation algorithm, we require all basic blocks and all
32-bit instructions to be aligned on a 32-bit boundary. This means that
validation can proceed 32 bits at a time, checking whether each word contains
either a single valid 32-bit instruction or two valid 16-bit instructions. No
type of branch is allowed to enter an address which is not 32-bit aligned.

Allowed 32-bit instruction encodings:

  11111000 11001001, 0xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx      str         r0-r7, [r9, #imm12]
  11111000 10x01001, 0xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx      str[bh]     r0-r7, [r9, #imm12]

  1111100x 10x1100x, 0xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx      ldr(s)[bh]  r0-r7, [r8-9, #imm12]
  11111000 1101100x, 0xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx      ldr         r0-r7, [r8-9, #imm12]

  11110x10 x100xxxx, 0xxx0xxx xxxxxxxx      mov[wt]     r0-r7, #imm16

Allowed 16-bit instruction encodings:

  00xxxxxx xxxxxxxx     lsl, lsr, asr, add, sub, mov, cmp
  010000xx xxxxxxxx     and, eor, lsl, lsr, asr, adc, sbc, ror,
                        tst, rsb, cmp, cmn, orr, mul, bic, mvn
  
  10110010 xxxxxxxx     uxth, sxth, uxtb, sxtb
  10111111 00000000     nop
  11011111 xxxxxxxx     svc

  01001xxx xxxxxxxx     ldr r0-r7, [PC, #imm8]
  1001xxxx xxxxxxxx     ldr/str r0-r7, [SP, #imm8]
  10101xxx xxxxxxxx     add r0-r7, SP, #imm8

Near branches are allowed, assuming the target address is within the code
region of the same page, and the target is 32-bit aligned:

  1011x0x1 xxxxxxxx     cb(n)z
  1101xxxx xxxxxxxx     bcc
  11100xxx xxxxxxxx     b


Assisted operations
-------------------

Many common operations require hypercall assistance:

 - Stack frame adjustments
 - Long branches
 - Procedure call and return
 - Pointer validation
 - Application-visible system calls

All hypercalls are implemented using SVC. We could optionally use the
BKPT or the permanently undefined regions as well, if we require more than
8 bits of parameter space.

SVC encodings:

  11011111 0xxxxxxx     (1) Indirect operation
  11011111 10xxxxxx     (2) Direct syscall #0-63
  11011111 110xxxxx     (3) SP = validate(SP - imm5*4)
  11011111 11100rrr     (4) r8 = validate(rN)
  11011111 11101rrr     (5) r9 = validate(rN)
  11011111 11110rrr     (6) Call validate(rN), with SP adjust
  11011111 11111rrr     (7) Tail call validate(rN), with SP adjust

Direct syscalls shall be used for very common operations: memcpy, memset,
floating point, return, SP adjust, etc.

When the MSB of the SVC immediate is clear, the other 7 bits are multiplied by
four and added to the base of the current page, to form the address of a
32-bit literal. This 32-bit literal encodes an indirect operation to perform:

  0nnnnnnn aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaa00   (1) Call validate(F+a*4), SP -= n*4
  0nnnnnnn aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaa01   (2) Tail call validate(F+a*4), SP -= n*4
  0xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx1x   (3) Reserved
  10nnnnnn nnnnnnnn iiiiiiii iiiiiii0   (4) Syscall #0-8191, with #imm16
  10nnnnnn nnnnnnnn iiiiiiii iiiiiii1   (4) Tail syscall #0-8191, with #imm16
  110nnnnn aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa   (5) Addrop #0-31 on validate(a)
  111nnnnn aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa   (6) Addrop #0-31 on validate(F+a)

  (F = 0x80000000, flash segment virtual address)

Address operations are like syscalls, but they have a 24-bit immediate which
is always interpreted as a validated flash address:

  0x80  Long branch
  0x81  Asynchronous preload
  0x82  Assign to r8
  0x83  Assign to r9
