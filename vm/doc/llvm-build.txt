Build-time configuration for Clang and LLVM in deps:

--enable-targets=arm --target=arm --disable-jit --disable-docs --disable-threads --disable-pthreads --disable-pic --disable-libffi

XXX: On the Linux build, this failed while trying to link libclang.so (due to lack of -fPIC) but that's okay... we didn't ask for nor need a shared lib.
