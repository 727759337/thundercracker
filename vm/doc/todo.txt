Optimization opportunities:

- Preserve r1-r7 across function calls. Right now these regs
  are being marked as killed, causing shared parameters to spill
  into other registers unnecessarily.

- More work on identifying opportunities to use imm12 addressing

- Equal optimization weight for all 16-bit instructions? LDRpc alone is
  better than LDRpc plus MOVs, for example.

- Flash block packing and alignment!

- Try to fill NOP padding slots with useful 16-bit instructions

- Use MOVWi16 instead of LDRpc for RAM symbols (we know they fit in 16 bits)
