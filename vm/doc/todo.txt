Correctness:

- Flash block packing and alignment!

Optimization opportunities:

- Optimize out redundant base pointer validations
- Preserve r1-r7 across function calls. Right now these regs
  are being marked as killed, causing shared parameters to spill
  into other registers unnecessarily.
- More work on identifying opportunities to use imm12 addressing
- Equal optimization weight for all 16-bit instructions? LDRpc alone is
  better than LDRpc plus MOVs, for example.
- Try to fill NOP padding slots with useful 16-bit instructions
- Use MOVWi16 instead of LDRpc for RAM symbols (we know they fit in 16 bits)
- More efficient comparison generation (See ARMTargetLowering::getARMCmp)

Debugging support:

- Explicit command line options, debug vs. release
- In release builds, emit *nothing* that isn't necessary. Can probably
  omit the ELF segment table entirely, and include only the necessary
  sections.
- Debug builds: symbol tables, segment table, dwarf-2 symbols, etc.
- gdb stub! (Would this work with stock ARM gdb, or would we need a
  special build?)
