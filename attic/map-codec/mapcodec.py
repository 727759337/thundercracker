    #
    # Four-point sampled window
    #
    # This is an attempt to combine the encoding features of DVarNib_2
    # with the best parts of a windowed codec. In datasets where
    # windowed compression gives us MUCH better results, like "title",
    # the reason windowed works so well is that it finds nearby tiles
    # with similar values. Larger window sizes are super-useful if they
    # let us find matches from vertically adjacent tiles.
    #
    # In the case of our VRAM compression codec, we really don't want
    # to spend the CPU on scanning a large window LZ77-style. So, we'd
    # like to do few comparisons. We can take advantage of the fact
    # that most matches in our windowed codecs come from tiles which
    # are very nearby. If we know about both horizontal and vertical
    # dimensions in the image, we can limit each to a few tiles. This
    # reduces the number of codes we need to use, and it keeps the
    # number of comparisons in the comppressor to a minimum.
    #
    # Here's the pattern we currently check, where X is the tile being
    # compressed, and '.' is a tile we ignore:
    #
    #  . . . . .

    # taken in reference to one of these four sampling points. So, it
