/**
 * @brief A memory buffer which holds captured motion data.
 *
 * This is a FIFO buffer which captures timestamped accelerometer samples.
 * Samples are enqueued and timestamps are generated the moment a relevant
 * packet arrives over the radio from a cube. Timestamps are collected
 * using the system clock, and stored as 8-bit deltas.
 *
 * Like a VideoBuffer, a MotionBuffer can be used with at most one CubeID
 * at a time, but this association can change at runtime. The size of a
 * MotionBuffer may also be modified, in order to trade off between capture
 * duration and memory usage.
 *
 * This captured accelerometer data may be directly read by signal processing
 * code in userspace, or it may be processed with lower CPU overhead with
 * the help of the provided higher-level methods.
 *
 * MotionBuffers are templatized by buffer size. The default should be
 * sufficient for most uses, but if you need to save a longer motion
 * history the size can be adjusted to a maximum of 256 samples.
