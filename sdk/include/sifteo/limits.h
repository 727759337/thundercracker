/*
 * Every game can individually define a compile-time limit for the
 * number of supported cubes. It must be less than or equal to the
 * firmware limit (currently 32). Many data structures are statically
 * allocated using this number, so if a game is running low on RAM it
 * can decrease the limit, or if it needs more cubes it can be
 * increased.
