/**
 * A memory buffer which holds graphics data. This is a mirror of the
 * remote graphics memory in each cube's hardware. By writing to this
 * buffer, changes are enqueued for later transmission to the physical
 * video buffer.
 *
 * Cubes have a few basic video features that are always available:
 * rotation, windowing, and selecting a video mode. This class provides
 * access to those features, as well as low-level primitives for accessing
 * the underlying video buffer memory.
 *
 * The layout and meaning of video memory changes depending on what mode
 * you're in. This class provides a union of mode-specific accessors you
 * can use.
 *
 * VideoBuffers can be used with at most one CubeID at a time, though
 * this association between cubes and video buffers can change at runtime.
 * Most games will want to have one VideoBuffer per cube, but if you plan to
 * support very large numbers of cubes, it may be necessary to have fewer
 * VideoBuffers that are shared among a larger number of cubes.
 *
 * VideoBuffers must be explicitly attached to a cube.
 * See VideoBuffer::attach() and CubeID::detachVideoBuffer().
 *
 * If you're accessing the low-level VideoBuffer memory directly, it is
 * strongly recommended that you're aware of the synchronization protocol
 * used in this buffer, to keep it consistent between the system software
 * and your application.  See abi.h for details on this protocol.
