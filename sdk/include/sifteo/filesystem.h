/**
 * @brief A lightweight ID for a persistently stored object.
 * 
 * Games may read and write such objects stored in a key-value
 * dictionary associated with their volume. The key space is limited.
 * Valid keys range from 0 to LIMIT. These keys may be allocated manually
 * or automatically.
 * 
 * If you're computing keys dynamically, cast your key to a StoredObject
 * in order to access the object data at that key. If you're allocating keys
 * statically, you can create global StoredObject instances which act as
 * a single place to associate IDs with names.
 * 
 * By default, objects are both read from and written to a store associated
 * with the current game's Volume. It is possible to read another game's
 * stored data (by specifying its Volume) but you may not write to another
 * game's object store.
 *
 * Objects are stored in a journaled filesystem, and writes are synchronous.
 * By design, if power fails or the system is otherwise interrupted during
 * a write, future reads will continue to return the last successfully-written
 * version of an object.
 *
 * Object sizes must be at least one byte, and no more than MAX_SIZE bytes.
