 * Definition of the Application Binary Interface for Sifteo games.
 *
 * Whereas the rest of the SDK is effectively a layer of malleable
 * syntactic sugar, this defines the rigid boundary between a game and
 * its execution environment. Everything in this file posesses a
 * binary compatibility guarantee.
 *
 * The ABI is defined in plain C, and all symbols are namespaced with
 * '_SYS' so that it's clear they aren't meant to be used directly by
 * game code.
