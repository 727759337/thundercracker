/*
 * The _SYSVideoBuffer is a low-level data structure that serves to
 * collect graphics state updates so that the system can send them
 * over the radio to cubes.
 *
 * These buffers allow the system to send graphics data at the most
 * optimal time, in the most optimal format, and without any
 * unnecessary redundancy.
 *
 * VRAM is organized as a 1 kB array of bytes or words. We keep a few
 * bitmaps at different resolutions, for the synchronization protocol
 * below.  These bitmaps are ordered MSB-first.
 *
 * To support the system's asynchronous access requirements, these
 * buffers have a very strict synchronization protocol that user code
 * must observe:
 *
 *  1. Set the 'lock' bit(s) for any words you plan to update,
 *     using Atomic::Store().
 *
 *  2. Update the VRAM buffer, using any method and in any order you like.
 *
 *  3. Set change bits in cm1, using Atomic::Or()
 *
 *  4. Set change bits in cm32, using Atomic::Or(). After this point the
 *     system may start sending data over the radio at any time.
 *
 *  5. As soon after step (4), clear the lock bits you set in (1). Since
 *     the system treats lock bits as read-only, you can do this using
 *     Atomic::Store() again.
 *
 * Note that cm32 is the primary trigger that the system uses in order
 * to determine if hardware VRAM needs to be updated. The lock bits do
 * not prevent the system from reading VRAM, but rather they're used as
 * part of the following invariant:
 *
 *  - For any given word, we are guaranteed that the hardware's value
 *    matches the current buffered value if and only if the 'lock' bit
 *    is zero and the 'cm1' bit is zero.
 *
 * If not for the lock bits, this invariant would not be possible to
 * maintain, since the system would have no idea when userspace code
 * has modified the buffer, if it hasn't yet set the cm1 bits.
 *
 * Streaming over the radio can begin any time after cm32 has been
 * updated. For bandwidth efficiency, it's best to wait until after a
 * large update, then OR a single value with cm32 in order to trigger
 * the update.
 *
 * The system may still start streaming updates while the 'lock' bit
 * is set, but it will not be able to use the full range of protocol
 * optimization techniques, since some of these rely on knowing for
 * certain the values of words that have already been transmitted. So
 * it is recommended that userspace clear the 'lock' bits as soon as
 * possible after cm32 is set.
