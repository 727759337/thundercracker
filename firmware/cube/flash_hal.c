/*
 * Flash hardware abstraction layer.
 *
 * Currently this is written for SST flashes, specifically the
 * SST39VF1681. But we expect to have to modify this to suit whatever
 * commodity flash memory we source for the product.

 NOTE: this has been updated to also support the Winbond W29GL032C.
 Relevant changes:
  - flash_addr_lat2 increments by 2 instead of 4 for adjacent sector addresses for erase
  - lat1 and lat2 lines are swapped on buddy cube rev 1 - this is accounted for in hardware.h
  - due to a routing error on buddy cube rev 1, we must use WORD_MODE instead of
    BYTE_MODE, and your board must be modded accordingly, since the BYTE select
    pin would normally be tied low.

 TODO: the winbond part also provides a bulk programming mode that would allow
        us to optimize by  only sending the unlock sequence for each
        batch of bytes that we want to program, rather than for each byte as we do now.

 * also rather lower power consumption, since we aren't toggling an
 * external pin in a tight loop!

 * This polling is based on examining the most significant bit of the
