 *  Packet length:   16 bits     Long enough for one data byte and one check byte
 *  # of timeslots:  32          Maximum number of supported cubes in master
 *  Timeslot size:   192 us      Period is split evenly into 32 slots
 *
 * These parameters on their own would give us a maximum bit period of
 * 12 us.  But that assumes that we can perfectly synchronize all
 * cubes. The more margin we can give ourselves for timer drift and
 * communication latency, the better. Our electronics seem to be able
 * to handle pulses down to ~4 us, but it's also better not to push these
 * limits.
 *
 * The other constraint on bit rate is that we need it to divide evenly
 * into our clk/12 timebase (0.75 us).
 *
 * To ensure that we stay within our timeslot even if we can't begin
 * transmitting immediately, we have a deadline, measured in Timer 0
 * ticks (clk/12). The maximum value of this deadline is our timeslot
 * size minus the packet length. But we'll make it a little bit
 * shorter still, so that we preserve our margin for radio latency.

/*
 * Timer 0 ISR --
 *
 *    This is a relatively low-frequency ISR that we use to kick off
 *    reading most of our sensors. Currently it handles neighbor TX,
 *    and it initiates I2C reads.
 *
 *    This timer runs at 162.76 Hz. It's a convenient frequency for us
 *    to get from the 16 MHz oscillator, but it also works out nicely
 *    for other reasons:
 * 
 *      1. It's similar to our accelerometer's analog bandwidth
 *      2. It works out well as a neighbor transmit period (32x 192us slots)
 *      3. It's good for human-timescale interactivity
 *
 *    Because neighbor transmits must be interleaved, we allow the
 *    master to adjust the phase of Timer 0. This does not affect the
 *    period. To keep the latencies predictable, we perform our
 *    neighbor transmit first-thing in this ISR.

     * This is a maze of IRQs, all with very specific priority
     * assignments.  Here's a quick summary:
     *
     *  - Prio 0 (lowest)
     *
     *    Radio
     *
     *       This is a very long-running ISR. It really needs to be
     *       just above the main thread in priority, but no higher.
     *
     *  - Prio 1 
     *
     *    Accelerometer (I2C)
     *
     *       I2C is somewhat time-sensitive, since we do need to
     *       service it within a byte-period. But this is a fairly
     *       long-timescale operation compared to our other IRQs, and
     *       there's no requirement for predictable latency.
     *
     *  - Prio 2
     *
     *    Master clock (Timer 0)
     *
     *       We need to try our best to service Timer 0 with
     *       predictable latency, within several microseconds, so that
     *       we can reliably begin our neighbor transmit on-time. This
     *       is what keeps us inside the timeslot that we were
     *       assigned.
     *
     *       XXX: This isn't possible with Timer 0, since it shares a
     *       priority level with the radio!
     *
     *  - Prio 3 (highest)
     *
     *    Neighbor pulse counter (Timer 1)
     *
     *       Absolutely must have low and predictable latency. We use
     *       this timer to line up our bit clock with the received
     *       bit, an operation that needs to be accurate down to just
     *       a couple dozen clock cycles.
     *
     *    Neighbor bit TX/RX (Timer 2)
     *
     *       This is the timer we use to actually sample/generate bits.
     *       It's our baud clock. Timing is critical for the same reasons
