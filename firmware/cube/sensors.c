/*
 * I2C ISR --
 *
 *    This is where we handle accelerometer reads. Since I2C is a
 *    pretty slow bus, and the hardware has no real buffering to speak
 *    of, we use this IRQ to implement a state machine that executes
 *    our I2C read byte-by-byte.
 *
 *    These reads get kicked off during the Radio ISR, so that we'll
 *    start taking a new accel reading any time the previous reading,
 *    if any, had a chance to be retrieved.
 *
 *    The kick-off (writing the first byte) is handled by some inlined
 *    code in sensors.h, which we include in the radio ISR.
