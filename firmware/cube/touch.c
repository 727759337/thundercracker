 *
 * NOTE: Be careful with this routine, as it is an ISR. In particular, if you
 *       do any operations which end up requiring DPTR (function calls, lookup
 *       tables, any kind of xdata access) you'll need some assembly to save
 *       and restore it in a way that's dual-dptr aware. So, save DPS as well,
 *       and reset DPS to zero before using DPTR.
