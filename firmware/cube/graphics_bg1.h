/*
 * Additional definitions specific to BG1, shared between BG1-derived modes.
 *
 * BG1 has some important differences relative to BG0:
 * 
 *   - It is screen-sized (16x16) rather than 18x18. BG1 is not intended
 *     for 'endless' scrolling, like BG0 is.
 *
 *   - When panned, it does not wrap at the map edge. Pixels from 128
 *     to 255 are transparent in both axes, so the overlay can be smoothly
 *     scrolled into and out of frame.
 *
 *   - Tile addresses in BG1 cannot be computed using a simple multiply,
 *     they must be accumulated by counting '1' bits in the allocation
 *     bitmap.
 *
 * The 8-bit virtual address space is important. Just like BG2, this is a
 * virtual 256x256 space, in which the first quadrant (16x16 tiles) is occupied
 * and all other space is empty. In our case, the empty space corresponds to
 * bits in the BG1 bitmap which are always zero.
 *
 * This means we're shifting 32 bits per line. That would be kind of ridiculous,
 * but we have this handy peripheral to help us out: the Nordic's MDU. This has
 * a 32-bit wide shifter that can shift 2 bits per clock cycle. We keep the current
 * bitmap line in the MDU's 32-bit register.
