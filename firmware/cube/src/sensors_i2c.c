 * I2C ISR --
 *
 *    This is where we handle accelerometer reads. Since I2C is a
 *    pretty slow bus, and the hardware has no real buffering to speak
 *    of, we use this IRQ to implement a state machine that executes
 *    our I2C read byte-by-byte.
 *
 *    These reads get kicked off right after the neighbor ISR, so that we'll
 *    start taking a new accel reading any time the previous reading,
 *    if any, had a chance to be retrieved.
 *
 *    After every accelerometer read finishes, we do a quick poll for
 *    factory test commands.

 * at a relatively pokey 10 kBps) and instead we're really trying to
 * conserve code space.
 *
 * So, each state here is actually called rather than jumped to, since
 * we can return with a new state in 'a' using fewer bytes than if we
 * had to set i2c_state and sjmp.

 * This state machine is VERY TIGHT. The last state label needs to be
 * within 255 bytes of the beginning of the function. There is just barely
