/*
 * Timer 0 ISR --
 *
 *    This is a relatively low-frequency ISR that we use to kick off
 *    reading most of our sensors. Currently it handles neighbor TX,
 *    and it initiates I2C reads.
 *
 *    This timer runs at 162.76 Hz. It's a convenient frequency for us
 *    to get from the 16 MHz oscillator, but it also works out nicely
 *    for other reasons:
 * 
 *      1. It's similar to our accelerometer's analog bandwidth
 *      2. It works out well as a neighbor transmit period (32x 192us slots)
 *      3. It's good for human-timescale interactivity
 *
 *    Because neighbor transmits must be interleaved, we allow the
 *    master to adjust the phase of Timer 0. This does not affect the
 *    period. To keep the latencies predictable, we perform our
 *    neighbor transmit first-thing in this ISR.
