/*
 * Low-level hardware abstraction layer.
 *
 * Specific to Winbond W29GL032C or similar. Assumptions:
 *
 *   - 8-bit parallel bus
 *   - 32-byte programming buffer
 *   - 64 KB sector erase
 *
 * This HAL assumes we always program the flash 16 words at a time,
 * and we auto-erase just before programming any page that starts
 * at the beginning of an erase-sector.
 *
 * To program:
 *
 *   - Set the address (flash_addr_*)
 *   - Call flash_buffer_begin()
 *   - Call flash_buffer_word() exactly 32 times
 *   - Call flash_buffer_commit()
 *   - The address will have now been incremented by 32 bytes
 *
 * There is no longer any distinction between beginning/ending one
 * buffer vs. beginning/ending a higher-level programming "operation".
 * Calling flash_buffer_commit() always waits for the write to complete.
 * This takes approximately 96us (1500 cycles) on the W29GL032C.
 * Because this delay is so long, any useful work we'd have to do between
 * buffers would be short compared to the time we spend waiting, so it's
 * not worth the code size and complexity.
