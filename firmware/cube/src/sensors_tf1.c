/*
 * Timer 1 ISR --
 *
 *    We use Timer 1 in counter mode, to count incoming neighbor pulses.
 *    We use it both to detect the start pulse, and to detect subsequent
 *    pulses in our serial stream.
 *
 *    We only use the Timer 1 ISR to detect the start pulse. We keep the
 *    counter loaded with 0xFFFF when the receiver is idle. At other times,
 *    the counter value is small and won't overflow.
 *
 *    This interrupt is at the highest priority level! It's very important
 *    that we detect the start pulse with predictable latency, so we can
 *    time the subsequent pulses accurately.
