     * Iterate over the sprites in VRAM.
     *
     * Do the Y test on each sprite. For each sprite that passes the
     * Y test, set the corresponding bit in y_spr_active and init
     * the X parameters in x_spr.
     *
     * dptr: Source address, in _SYS_VA_SPR
     *   r0: Dest address, in _x_spr
     *   r1: tile index adjustment
     *   r2: Loop counter
     *   r3: Copy of _y_spr_line
     *   r4: mask_y
     *   r5: mask_x
     *   r6: Sprite Y offset
     *   r7: pos_x 
     *
     * In general, we'd like _SYSSpriteInfo to be laid out in the same
     * order that it's most convenient to read here; i.e. all Y params
     * first, then X, then tile. But it's even more important that we keep
     * X/Y values packed into the same word, so they can be atomically
     * updated by our radio protocol.
     *
     * The end result of this loop is a tightly packed array of X-coordinate
     * information for only those sprites that are visible on the current
     * scanline.
     *
     * The particular encoding we use for sprite locations is kind of cool.
     * The width/height are powers of two, and the positions are arbitrary
     * signed 8-bit ints. They are all stored negated. The arithmetic works
     * out such that the negated width/height becomes a bit mask. If you add
     * the negated position to the current raster position, you get the pixel
     * offset from the beginning of the sprite. This isn't surprising, since 
     * really you just subtracted the sprite origin from the raster position.
     *
     * The cool part: AND that with the mask. The negated mask is the same thing
     * as ~(width-1), or the inverse of a bitmask that has log2(width) bits set.
     * So, if you AND this with the adjusted position and you don't get zero,
     * that tells you that the position is outside the sprite. This is a little
     * faster than doing a normal inequality test.
     *
     * The other common test we'll perform: We want to know, for the next N pixels,
     * will the sprite show up anywhere in that region. We use this here to
     * test whether the sprite is on-screen horizontally at all, and we can use it
     * in our inner loops to test whether a sprite shows up within a particular
     * tile.
     *
     * For this test, we can start with the same mask test. That will tell us if
     * we're already in the sprite. If and only if we aren't, we can see if it's
     * coming up soon by adding N to the adjusted sprite position, and checking
     * for overflow.
