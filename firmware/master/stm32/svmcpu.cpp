/*
 * SVC handler.
 * Copy cortex-m3 stacked registers (HwContext) to trusted memory,
 * and copy regs 4-11 to trusted memory for manipulation by the runtime.
 *
 * After runtime handling, the desired user stack pointer may have been modified,
 * so copy the hardware stacked regs to this location, and update the user sp
 * before exiting such that HW unstacking finds them at the correct location.
 *
 * Note: It is very important for security that we do copy out the trusted registers
 *       into trusted memory during the SVC. Due to the hardware's interrupt dispatch
 *       behaviour, we must briefly store some of our trusted registers (including
 *       the program counter!) to the user stack. If we left them there, user code
 *       could use a syscall (like memcpy) to modify them during the SVC. Then we
 *       could return to a modified (userspace-specified) return address. Instant
 *       sandbox escape. We can prevent this form of attack by storing the trusted
 *       registers separately, in secure memory.
 *
 * XXX:  The door is still open (but just barely) for a specific kind of attack
 *       in which a malicious userspace app could abuse a higher-priority ISR
 *       to modify this hardware-stacked data before we can save it or after we
 *       restore it. For example, the radio ISR could write to a MotionBuffer
 *       or VideoBuffer on behalf of an app. It would be difficult to successfully
 *       execute an attack this way given the largely non-user-determined nature of
 *       the data you could convince the system to write: but it's certainly possible.
 *
 *       One way to avoid this bug may be to have all other interrupts masked during
 *       these critical sections. We woule need a way for hardware to treat SVC as
 *       a very high priority interrupt in which most other things are masked, but
 *       we would then unmask the other interrupts in software around the actual
 *       handler() invocation below.
