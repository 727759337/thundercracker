nRF8001 Driver
--------------

The nRF8001 is wra Bluetooth LE controller by Nordic Semiconductor.

Nearly the entire BTLE stack runs on-chip, which means we have an awful lot of
configuration data to push to the nRF8001 at powerup. Nordic's solution to
this problem is a proprietary tool which generates a blob of undocumented
SETUP packets.

This subdirectory includes Sifteo's driver proper, as well as the
configuration data as generated by Nordic's tools. The "config.xml" source
file can be opened with Nordic's nRFgo Studio tool. There, it can be edited,
and you can generate "services.h" which contains the binary SETUP data.
