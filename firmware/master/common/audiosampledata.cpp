     * OPTIMIZATION NOTE:

     *    We're still processing samples in very small blocks for the most part!
     *    I think the next big untapped reservoir of performance here is in mapping/decoding
     *    more samples at once. Currently we have two small buffers, the samples[] buffer
     *    here and the 'extra' sample in the ADPCMDecoder. Right now this decoder is optimized
     *    for quickly skipping samples, but that isn't what it's usually used for. Here's a
     *    histogram of typical (target - numSamples) values on entry, while playing an
     *    8-channel module:
     *
     *       1 byte:   54.78%
     *       2 bytes:  25.39%
     *       3 bytes:  17.21%
     *       4 bytes:   2.62%
     *       5+ bytes:  0.00%
     *
     *    So! We'd likely get *much* better performance if we decoded ADPCM data in
     *    fixed-size and well-aligned blocks, then inlined our accessors to that
     *    tiny buffer. (which could also be a direct-mapped cache like samples[])
