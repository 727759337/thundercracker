 * Frame rate control parameters:
 *
 * fpsLow --
 *    "Minimum" frame rate. If we're waiting more than this long
 *    for a frame to render, give up. Prevents us from getting wedged
 *    if a cube stops responding.
 *
 * fpsHigh --
 *    Maximum frame rate. Paint will always block until at least this
 *    long since the previous frame, in order to provide a global rate
 *    limit for the whole app.
 *
 * fpContinuous --
 *    When at least this many frames are pending acknowledgment, we
 *    switch to continuous rendering mode. Instead of waiting for a
 *    signal from us, the cubes will just render continuously.
 *
 * fpSingle --
 *    The inverse of fpContinuous. When at least this few frames are
 *    pending, we switch back to one-shot triggered rendering.
 *
 * fpMax --
 *    Maximum number of pending frames to track. If we hit this limit,
 *    Paint() calls will block.
 *
 * fpMin --
 *    Minimum number of pending frames to track. If we go below this
 *    limit, we'll start ignoring acknowledgments.
