 *
 * Since there's a single global CRC engine with global state, we have
 * to be careful about when the Crc32 is used. Currently it is NOT
 * allowed to use the CRC asynchronously from SVM execution. So, not in
 * the radio ISR, button ISR, or any other exception handler other than
 * SVC. It is also NOT acceptable to use Crc32 from inside low-level
 * parts of the flash stack, since it's used internally by the Volume
 * and LFS layers.
 *
 * This CRC engine is also exposed to userspace, via the _SYS_crc32()
