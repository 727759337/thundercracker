/**
 * Abstraction for low-level radio communications, and

 * platforms will have separate implementations of this class.
 *
 * In order to allow efficient use of memory and CPU, we let
 * the Radio object manage control flow and buffering.
 *
 * We assume it will be performing DMA on a per-packet basis, and
 * that it's more efficient overall to construct the packet in a
 * system-memory buffer and DMA it to the radio engine, than to
 * emit individual bytes via PIO.
 *
 * The overall flow control model is one in which application code
 * runs in one or more main threads, and hardware events are
 * handled in ISRs in a platform-specific way.
 *
 * We abstract this as a set of radio callbacks which are invoked
 * asynchronously, and possibly in an interrupt context. See
 * RadioManager for these callbacks.
 *
 * The overall Radio device only has a few operations it does
 * synchronously, accessible via members of this class
 * itself. Initialization, of course. And when we have nothing
 * better to do, we can halt() to enter a low-power state until an
 * interrupt arrives. This is similar to the x86 HLT instruction.
 *
 * XXX: This class should also include power management features,
 *      especially transmit power control and transmit frequency
 *      control. For now, we're assuming that every transmit
 *      opportunity will be taken.
