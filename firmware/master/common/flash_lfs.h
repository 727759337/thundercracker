 * LFS layer: our Log-structured File System
 *
 * This is an optional layer which can sit on top of the Volume layer.
 * While it's totally feasible to use Volumes directly, for storing large
 * immutable objects, the LFS is designed to provide an efficient way to
 * store small objects that may change frequently.
 *
 * This LFS is a fairly classic implementation of the general LFS concept.
 * For more background information, check out Wikipedia:
 *
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system
 *
 * Each Volume in the filesystem may act as the parent for an LFS, which
 * occupies zero or more child volumes of that parent. These volumes are
 * used as a ring buffer for stored objects.
 *
 * Objects are identified in three ways:
 *
 *   1. Their parentage. Each object is "owned" by a particular volume,
 *      typically a Game or the Launcher. This forms the top-level namespace
 *      under which objects are stored.
 *
 *   2. An 8-bit key identifies distinct objects within a particular parent
 *      volume. These keys are opaque identifiers for us. Games may use
 *      them to differentiate between different kinds of saved data, such
 *      as different types of metrics, or different save-game slots.
 *
 *   3. A version. Because several copies of an object may exist in flash,
 *      we need to know which one is the most recent. This ordering is
 *      implied by the physical order of objects within a single LFS volume,
 *      and the ordering of LFS volumes within a particular LFS is stated
 *      explicitly via a sequence number in the volume header.

/**
 * FlashLFSKeyFilter is a probabilistic data structure that can be used to
 * test whether a key is maybe-in the set or definitely-not-in the set.
 *
 * This is equivalent to a very tiny Bloom filter with a single trivial hash
 * function (k=1). Whereas the generalized Bloom filter is good for cases
 * where the space of keys is very large compared to the size of the filter,
 * this object is intended for cases where there's only an order of magnitude
 * or so of difference: We have 256 possible keys, and 16 bits of hash.
 *
 * These sizes were chosen so that this KeyFilter can be used to build a fast
 * "meta-index" that tells us which index pages we need to examine. This
 * must fit within the type-specific-data region in each Volume.
 *
 * In order to optimize for cases where games use small counting numbers for
 * keys, we opt to use a trivial hash function: the low 4 bits of every key.
 * This way, if a game chooses to use keys from 1 through 16, for example,
 * they will all occupy distinct filter bits, and our scan of the meta-index
 * will tell us for sure which index page we need. If there are collisions,
 * we still operate correctly, we just may need to load additional index
 * pages that we don't actually need.
 *
 * Because this filter must operate in flash memory, and adding an item must
 * not require an erase, we invert the typical Bloom filter bit values. "1"
 * represents an empty hash bucket, "0" means that one or more items occupy
 * that bucket.

/**
 * FlashLFSIndexRecord is the data type which comprises our object index.
 * This stores all of the metadata we need to identify and load an object
 * from the LFS itself.
 *
 * Index records should be small: Larger index records require more flash
 * blocks to store, which means more meta-index records. The meta-index
 * must be small enough to keep in the Volume header block. This is one
 * of the reasons we keep the size of the key space limited. (The other
 * reason is to put a reasonable upper bound on the size of the whole LFS.)
 *
 * This record must hold enough information to (1) locate an object,
 * (2) very reliably determine whether any space has been allocated,
 * even if we experience a power failure during write, and (3) validate
 * the object, so we can fall back on a previous version if it's corrupted.
 *
 * This implementation requires 5 bytes of storage:
 *    - 8-bit key, 8-bit size
 *    - 16-bit CRC for the object contents
 *    - Check byte for key and size
 *
 * This lets us detect the difference between the two main power-fail modes:
 *
 *    1. We started to write the index, but didn't finish. This means
 *       we've wasted an index slot, but no space was actually allocated for
 *       the object, so that space is still free.
 *
 *    2. We finished writing the index, but the object data didn't finish
 *       writing. This will render the content CRC invalid, so we'll
 *       ignore this and use an earlier version of the same object.
