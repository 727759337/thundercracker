     * Produce the next radio packet to transmit. This module's
     * responsibility is to multiplex our available radio bandwidth
     * between all enabled CubeSlots and the CubeConnector.
     *
     * To ensure fair allocation of bandwidth, each of the possible
     * packet producers are given transmit opportunities in a
     * round-robin fashion. Each of these producers may give up their
     * transmit slot by returning false from radioProduce(), with the
     * exception of CubeConnector.
     *
     * To further complicate matters, we need to sequence our
     * transmissions to avoid exposing an nRF protocol limitation:
     * Each packet includes a 2-bit sequence number, used to detect
     * and discard duplicate packets when we retransmit after a
     * dropped ACK. The protocol was designed to assume each PTX
     * is transmitting to a single receiver at a time. But when
     * you multiplex one PTX among several receivers as we're doing,
     * there is still only a single global 2-bit counter for the
     * PTX. In the worst case, if we have exactly four cubes in
     * our round-robin rotation, we'll hit a duplicate packet ID
     * every time and every packet will be dropped!
     *
     * To avoid this, our scheduling algorithm has been designed
     * to specifically select only producers which would not cause
     * such a collision.
     *
     * We do this by maintaining four separate schedule queues, one
     * for each of the four possible PID values. The queue we put
     * a producer into is dictated by the PID that producer had
     * last time we gave it a transmit opportunity. Because we
     * have these four queues, we actually have no need to store
     * this last PID explicitly.
     *
     * At every transmit opportunity, we can ask any producer for
     * a packet as long as it's in a schedule *other* than the one
     * corresponding to the last PID we transmitted.
     *
     * We'd be stuck if the only pending producers were located on
     * the one queue corresponding to this last PID. If this does
     * happen, we have no choice but to transmit a dummy packet
     * or skip the producer for the current scheduling cycle. However,
     * we take a preventative measure by always choosing a producer
     * from the per-PID queue which the greatest number of items in it.
     * This way, we reduce our chances of using up a producer we
     * would really need to use later on in the cycle.
     *
     * This is clearly not a globally optimal algorithm, but it should
     * yield an optimal-enough solution in all cases, and it needs
     * to be efficient enough to run on every radio ISR :)
