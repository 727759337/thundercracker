 * This is a hardware-agnostic delegate which handles Bluetooth events.

 * We do not handle actual GATT characteristics here, since they're

 * Here, we handle high-level connection state events and we handle
 * "data" packets which are sent via generic "Data IN" and "Data OUT"
 * GATT characteristics.

 * This service contains at least the following characteristics:
 *
 * 1. Data IN (Base -> Host), Notify pipe, max data length 20 bytes.
 *    UUID: 566d0002-3c6f-8621-06d3-c14d4768bd75
 *
 * 2. Data OUT (Host -> Base), Write pipe with response, max data length 20 bytes.
 *    UUID: 566d0003-3c6f-8621-06d3-c14d4768bd75
 *
 * 3. System Version, Readable characteristic, fixed length of 4 bytes.
 *    UUID: 566d0004-3c6f-8621-06d3-c14d4768bd75
 *    This equals the version returned by _SYS_version(), in little endian.
