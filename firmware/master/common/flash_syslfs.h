/*
 * Definitions for the System's own LFS instance.
 *
 * An LFS instance can be attached to any volume on the filesystem.
 * Games and the system Launcher will each have their own personal LFS
 * to write into. This file describes the one special LFS which is made
 * up of volumes without a parent. These LFS volumes are owned by the system,
 * and used for things that are fairly low-level and shared amongst multiple
 * apps, like Cube pairing information and AssetSlot allocation.
 *
 * The main architectural distinction between this LFS and the Launcher's LFS,
 * which can also be used for "system"-seeming information, is that the
 * Launcher LFS normally can only be written to while the launcher is running.
 * The SysLFS, on the other hand, may be written to as a side-effect of running
 * any application.
 *
 * This distinction also lets us keep the system and launcher more decoupled
 * from each other, since they aren't sharing the same key-space. As an
 * additional practical consideration, the SysLFS key space is already fairly
 * densely utilized, so the Launcher wouldn't have much room left over.
