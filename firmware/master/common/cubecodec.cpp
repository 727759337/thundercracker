     * cm update (totally safe) but it isn't possible for any user
     * code to run during this ISR. So there's no need to worry about
     * atomicity in updating the cm here.
     *
     * Also note that we don't need to keep a separate pointer to
     * track our scan location in VRAM, since it's very cheap to use
     * our changemap to locate the first word in VRAM that needs
     * to be sent.
     *
     * Because of this, we effectively do a top-down scan of VRAM for
     * every RF packet. If something earlier on in the framebuffer was
     * changed by userspace, we'll go back and resend it before
     * sending later portions of the buffer. That's good in a way,
     * since it gives us a way to set a kind of QoS priority based on
     * VRAM address. But it means that userspace needs to consciously
     * delay writing to the changemap if it wants to avoid sending
     * redundant or out-of-order updates over the radio while a large
     * or multi-part update is in progress.
     *
     * This loop terminates when all of VRAM has been flushed, or when
     * we fill up the output packet. We assume that this function
     * begins with space available in the packet buffer.
