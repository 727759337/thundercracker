 * Neighbor Coalescing
 * 
 * Neighbors are not created until both cubes report the pair
 *      This way, application code can rely on all neighboring relationships
 *      being symmetric.
 * 
 * Neighbors are not removed until both cubes report the unpairing
 *      This reduces the amount of neighboring event noise coming from the 
 *      firmware.
 * 
 * gCoalescedPairs stores a global (cube X cube) -> (side X side) maps
 * 
 * coalescedNeighbors stores the "corrected" neighboring state, which should
 *      be used by the application, rather than the raw neighbors.
