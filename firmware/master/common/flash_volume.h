/*
 * Just above the Mapping layer in the flash stack, the Volume layer
 * is responsible for locating and allocating large discontiguous areas
 * ("Volumes") in flash. A Volume can contain, for example, an ELF object
 * file or a log-structured filesystem.
 *
 * Volumes support only a few operations:
 *
 *   - Enumeration. With no prior knowledge, we can list all of the volumes
 *     on our flash device by scanning for valid headers.
 *
 *   - Referencing. Without copying it, we can pin a FlashMap in our cache
 *     and use it to copy or map the volume's contents.
 *
 *   - Deleting. A volume can be marked as deleted, causing its space to
 *     be reclaimable for new volume allocations. Individual MapBlocks can
 *     be reclaimed in arbitrary order, as long as the header block is
 *     reclaimed last. Blocks should generally be reclaimed in order of
 *     increasing erase count. This means that the header block should
 *     typically be placed in the MapBlock with the highest erase count.
 *
 *   - Allocating. A volume of a given size can be allocated by erasing
 *     and reclaiming deleted MapBlocks.
 *
 * Note that erase counts are temporarily deleted during an Allocate operation.
 * If we lose power during an Allocate, the space behind that volume will be
 * unreachable from any other volume's map, but it is not actually marked as
 * deleted. This is also the state we're in when faced with an uninitialized
 * flash device. We'll do the best we can, and create new erase counts by
 * averaging all of the known erase counts from other blocks.
