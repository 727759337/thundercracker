/*
 * Just above the Mapping layer in the flash stack, the Volume layer
 * is responsible for locating and allocating large discontiguous areas
 * ("Volumes") in flash. A Volume can contain, for example, an ELF object
 * file or a log-structured filesystem.
 *
 * Volumes support only a few operations:
 *
 *   - Enumeration. With no prior knowledge, we can list all of the volumes
 *     on our flash device by scanning for valid headers.
 *
 *   - Referencing. Without copying it, we can pin a FlashMap in our cache
 *     and use it to copy or map the volume's contents.
 *
 *   - Deleting. A volume can be marked as deleted, causing its space to
 *     be reclaimable for new volume allocations. Individual MapBlocks can
 *     be reclaimed in arbitrary order, as long as the header block is
 *     reclaimed last. Blocks should generally be reclaimed in order of
 *     increasing erase count. This means that the header block should
 *     typically be placed in the MapBlock with the highest erase count.
 *
 *   - Allocating. A volume of a given size can be allocated by erasing
 *     and reclaiming deleted MapBlocks.
 *
 * Note that erase counts are temporarily deleted during an Allocate operation.
 * If we lose power during an Allocate, the space behind that volume will be
 * unreachable from any other volume's map, but it is not actually marked as
 * deleted. This is also the state we're in when faced with an uninitialized
 * flash device. We'll do the best we can, and create new erase counts by
 * averaging all of the known erase counts from other blocks.

/**
 * Manages the process of finding unused FlashMapBlocks to recycle.
 * Typically we look for blocks in deleted volumes, starting with
 * the lowest-erase-count blocks that aren't part of a volume header.
 *
 * We use header blocks only when all other blocks in that volume have
 * already been recycled, so that we don't lose any erase count data.
 *
 * If we spot any orphaned blocks (not part of any volume, even a deleted
 * one) we unfortunately have no way of knowing the true erase count of
 * those blocks. We prefer to use these orphaned blocks before recycling
 * deleted blocks, since we make up an erase count by taking the average
 * of all known erase counts. If we didn't use the orphaned blocks first,
 * the calculated pseudo-erase-count would increase over time, causing
 * these orphan blocks to systematically appear more heavily worn than
 * they actually are, causing us to overwear the non-orphaned blocks.
 *
 * This property of the recycler is especially important when dealing with
 * a blank or heavily damaged filesystem, in which large numbers of blocks
 * (possibly all of them) are orphaned.
 *
 * Much of the complexity here comes from trying to keep the memory usage
 * and algorithmic complexity low. For example, we don't want to spend the
 * memory on a full table of blocks sorted by erase count, nor do we want
 * to re-scan the device once per recycled block. It turns out that it isn't
 * actually important that we pick the absolute lowest-erase-count block
 * every time. As long as we tend to pick lower-erase-count blocks first,
 * and we accurately propagate erase counts, we'll still provide wear
 * leveling.
 *
 * Since we prefer to operate within a single deleted volume at a time,
 * our approach involves keeping a set of candidate volumes in which at least
 * one of their blocks has an erase count <= the average. This candidate list
 * is always preferred when searching for blocks to recycle.
