/*
 * Just above the Mapping layer in the flash stack, the Volume layer
 * is responsible for locating and allocating large discontiguous areas
 * ("Volumes") in flash. A Volume can contain, for example, an ELF object
 * file or a log-structured filesystem.
 *
 * Each volume begins with a volume header in its first MapBlock, containing:
 *
 *   - Prefix: Magic number, CRCs, type code, flags
 *   - Optional FlashMap, identifying all MapBlocks in the volume
 *   - Optional erase counts for all MapBlocks in the volume
 *
 * A volume header is responsible for storing this information on behalf of
 * the entire volume. For volumes consisting of multiple blocks, subsequent
 * blocks have no header of their own. This keeps the MapSpans for the volume
 * contiguous.
 *
 * Because the volume header is responsible for storing erase counts, and
 * we must take care to preserve these erase counts even in unused areas of
 * the flash, we need a way to mark the volume as "deleted" without
 * invalidating the other data stored in this header.
 *
 * Volumes support only a few operations:
 *
 *   - Enumeration. With no prior knowledge, we can list all of the volumes
 *     on our flash device by scanning for valid headers.
 *
 *   - Referencing. Without copying it, we can pin a FlashMap in our cache
 *     and use it to copy or map the volume's contents.
 *
 *   - Deleting. A volume can be marked as deleted, causing its space to
 *     be reclaimable for new volume allocations. Individual MapBlocks can
 *     be reclaimed in arbitrary order, as long as the header block is
 *     reclaimed last. Blocks should generally be reclaimed in order of
 *     increasing erase count. This means that the header block should
 *     typically be placed in the MapBlock with the highest erase count.
 *
 *   - Allocating. A volume of a given size can be allocated by erasing
 *     and reclaiming deleted MapBlocks.
 *
 * Note that erase counts are temporarily deleted during an Allocate operation.
 * If we lose power during an Allocate, the space behind that volume will be
 * unreachable from any other volume's map, but it is not actually marked as
 * deleted. This is also the state we're in when faced with an uninitialized
 * flash device. We'll do the best we can, and create new erase counts by
 * averaging all of the known erase counts from other blocks.
 *
 * Layout of a FlashVolume's first MapBlock:
 *
 *   First cache block:
 *      - Fixed size "Prefix" struct, containing type/flag-specific fields
 *      - Optional FlashMap
 *
 *   Optional, ERASE_COUNT_BLOCKS blocks of erase count data:
 *      - A uint32_t erase count for each of NUM_MAP_BLOCKS
 *
 *   Payload data begins.
