 *
 * Master -> Cube (RF) packet format
 *
 *   Background
 *  ------------
 *
 * This particular packet format is by far the most critical form of
 * compression for us to optimize during gameplay. This protocol forms
 * the link between our virtual framebuffer on the master, and a
 * cube's actual framebuffer. It needs to be tuned for transmitting
 * tile index data very efficiently.
 *
 * Tile indices are tricky, because they're relatively big 14-bit
 * values. If we had memory for a huffman table or a big LUT, we could
 * reduce the size of our codes considerably by taking advantage of
 * the fact that we're only using a small subset of the tile space at
 * once.
 *
 * But this is impractical, because of memory limitations on both
 * sides, and because we want this protocol to be very fast to
 * encode. So, instead, we take advantage of another properties that
 * these tile indices have:
 *
 *    Tile indices are often numerically close to tiles that are
 *    physically close.
 *
 * This property means that we can get great ratios with coders that
 * support adding a delta to some previous index that we find in a
 * window buffer. Unfortunately, a typical LZ77-style window buffer
 * would take a nontrivial amount of RAM in the decoder, and the
 * encoder would need to spend a lot of CPU searching for occurrances
 * of values in the window.
 *
 * After much experimentation (see attic/map-codec) I think I found a
 * good compromise. This is a codec whose "window" consists of four
 * carefully chosen sample points in the destination buffer: (X is the
 * tile being compressed)
 *
 *   . . . . .
 *   . 3 2 . .
 *   1 0 X . .
 *   . . . . .
 *
 * We can encode copies or small deltas from these sample points very
 * efficiently, with an RLE layer which handles simple horizontal and
 * vertical runs, as well as sequences of stepped tile indices.
 *
 * The specific wire encoding is inspired by a few other algorithms.
 * In particular, the unary-encoded prefixes in Golomb-Rice codes, and
 * of course Huffman encoding's strategy of assigning shorter bit
 * streams to more frequent codes.
 *
 * I also wanted the wire encoding to be very efficient to decode on
 * an 8-bit MCU that has no barrel shifter, and I wanted to have
 * additional codes which support random-access to VRAM, as well as
 * 'escapes' into other communication modes, such as writing to the
 * Flash FIFO.
 *
 *   VRAM
 *  ----------
 *
 * The buffer we're writing to in this codec is termed VRAM, since
 * it's used as the source for all video rendering operations. The
 * exact format is specific to the video mode in use, but typically it
 * consists of 14-bit tile index data, arranged in grids with a stride
 * of 18 tiles:
 *
 *    llllllll0 hhhhhhhh0
 *
 * Where 'l' is the least significant 7 bits, and 'h' is the most
 * significant 7 bits. This layout matches the address latch format
 * used by the cube microcontroller. The LSBs must be zero, or display
 * corruption will result.
 *
 * It is possible to store other data in VRAM too. Depending on the
 * video mode, it may be useful to store full-range 8-bit values.  The
 * protocol supports this, but it isn't what we're optimizing for.
 *
 * Since this codec doesn't know about the specific video mode in use,
 * we always assume a fixed stride, even if the particular mode might
 * be using a different stride in parts of the buffer. This means that
 * our sampling points can be defined as a constant four-entry lookup
 * table to negative offsets in VRAM.
 *
 *   Encoding
 *  ----------
 *
 * The protocol uses a stream of 4-bit nybbles. Everything is nybble
 * aligned, but there is no guaranteed byte-alignment except where
 * specified. Bytes are encoded with the least significant nybble
 * first (Just like in the flash codec's RLE4). Order of bits within a
 * code field may vary according to the code, see bit orders (O:)
 * below.
 *
 * The protocol is stateful. In a maximally-long RF packet, the stream
 * continues, preserving all state, at the beginning of the next packet.
 * A single code may be split across the packet boundary.
 *
 * In case of a non-max-length RF packet, the decoder state is reset
 * at the end of the packet. This is designed to provide a way for the
 * decoder to re-synchronize in case of a transient error. If such
 * a packet ends with a partial code, that partial code is ignored.
 *
 *  I. Primary codes
 *
 * A primary code is one that can be operated on by subsequent
 * 'repeat' codes. There are two state variables associated with
 * primary codes: a two-bit sample number (S), and a 4-bit diff
 * (D). The operation of "writing one delta-word" means to perform a
 * new sample lookup from sample point S, add (D-7) to that sample,
 * write it to the current VRAM location as a 14-bit tile index, then
 * to advance the VRAM location by two bytes.
 *
 *   01ss                  Copy sample #s.
 *                         Sets S=s, D=0, write one delta-word.
 *
 *   10ss dddd             Diff against sample #s, in the range [-7, 8]
 *                         Sets S=s, D=d, write one delta-word.
 *
 *   11xx xxxx xxxx xxxx   Literal 14-bit index.
 *  O: fe 4321 9765 dcba   Writes the index to VRAM, then sets S=0, D=0.
 *
 *  II. Special codes
 *
 * These codes are encoded in a slightly more complex way. First of
 * all, we have a reserved region of the diff codes, which are
 * redundant encodings for the 4-bit 'copy' code:
 *
 *   1000 0111             Sensor timer sync escape
 *
 *   1001 0111             Reserved for future use
 *   1010 0111             Reserved for future use
 *   1011 0111             Reserved for future use
 *
 * Next, the RLE codes. These begin with a 4-bit code that repeats the
 * last primary code. However, consecutive copies of this repeat code
 * are not allowed. Instead, this is used to support additional
 * special code types:
 *
 *   00nn                               Write n+1 delta-words
 *
 *   000n 00nn                          Skip n+1 output words
 *      0   21
 *
 *   0010 00nn nnnn                     Write n+5 delta-words
 *          54 3210
 *
 *   0011 000x xxxx xxxx                Set write address to literal 9-bit word index
 *           9 4321 8765 
 *
 *   0011 0010 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx      Write a literal 16-bit word
 *             3210 7654 ba98 fedc      Writes the index to VRAM, then sets S=0, D=0.
 *
 *   0011 0011                          Escape to flash mode
 *
 * Note that the single-nybble RLE code is technically defined as the
 * above nybble plus any non-RLE subsequent nybble. The runs will not
 * actually be emitted until just before that subsequent nybble.
 *
 *  III. Flash escape
 *
 * The flash escape warrants further discussion. If this escape code
 * is seen anywhere in the compression stream, we ignore bits until
 * the next byte boundary, then the remainder of the packet is sent to
 * the flash FIFO. If we would have sent zero bytes to the FIFO (zero
 * or one nybbles between the escape code and the end of the packet)
 * we instead trigger a reset of the flash decoder state machine.
 *
 * Resets happen asynchronously, and are acknowledged by a one-byte
 * increment in the flash decoder's progress counter. No data should
 * be written to the decoder until the reset has been acknowledged.
 *
 *  IV. Sensor timer sync escape
 *
 * Like the Flash Escape, this switches from nybble mode to byte mode,
 * and consumes the remainder of the packet. In this case, only two
 * bytes are read, and the rest of the packet, if any, is discarded.
 *
 * These two bytes are used as a reload value for the master sensor
 * clock, which is momentarily stopped and restarted.

 * Flash Loadstream codec.
 *
 * The flash loader is a state machine that runs in the main "thread"
 * of the cube firmware, alternately with our graphics rendering
 * engine. It receives commands in a different format, via a FIFO that
 * can be written to via the RF protocol above.
 *
 * The flash loader operates on 8-bit opcodes, most of which support
 * RLE encoding. These opcodes can decode a number of tiles using a
 * particular codec, or they can program the color LUT. In combination
 * with the optimizers in STIR, this gives many of the benefits of
 * indexed color plus an LZ78-style dictionary. So it's a little bit
 * like GIF, but variable-bit-depth and very low-memory.
 *
 * This format also includes a few special codes, for changing write
 * address and doing block erases. There is also quite a lot of
 * reserved code-space, so this would be a plentiful area to add
 * expansion to the protocol if necessary.
 *
 * The decoder will automatically erase a flash block any time the first
 * tile in a block is about to be programmed.
