/*
 * This file implements a single SPI master controller.
 * The nRF24LE1 has two of these, one for the on-chip
 * SPI bus used by the radio, and one for the external
 * SPI bus.
 *
 * It's a simple TX/RX FIFO with Interrupt support. We
 * implement the controller itself, using a supplied callback
 * for emulating one byte of data transfer with the actual
 * SPI peripheral.
 *
 * The callback is invoked after the last bit of every
 * transferred byte. Its argument is the full byte that was sent
 * via MOSI, and its return value is the byte that the slave would
 * have been writing to MISO concurrently with that output byte.
 *
 * (This means that theoretically a simulated peripheral could "cheat"
 * and return a response that depended on the value of the byte written
 * over MOSI. Don't do that. Real hardware would have been clocking out
 * that response byte before it knew what the command byte was.)
