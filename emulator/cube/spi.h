/*
 * This file implements a single SPI master controller.  The nRF24LE1
 * has two of these, one for the on-chip SPI bus used by the radio,
 * and one for the external SPI bus.
 *
 * It's a simple TX/RX FIFO with Interrupt support. We implement the
 * controller itself, using a supplied callback for emulating one byte
 * of data transfer with the actual SPI peripheral.
 *
 * The callback is invoked after the last bit of every transferred
 * byte. Its argument is the full byte that was sent via MOSI, and its
 * return value is the byte that the slave would have been writing to
 * MISO concurrently with that output byte.
 *
 * (This means that theoretically a simulated peripheral could "cheat"
 * and return a response that depended on the value of the byte
 * written over MOSI. Don't do that. Real hardware would have been
 * clocking out that response byte before it knew what the command
 * byte was.)
 */

/*
 * This makes a few big assumptions about the SPI hardware, based on
 * my reading of the data sheet and my best guess as to how the
 * hardware is implemented. So far, these seem to match what we've
 * seen on real hardware.
 *
 * 1. There are no hidden wait states between register writes and
 *    starting a transfer.
 *
 * 2. There is no additional interrupt latency, beyond the
 *    already-assumed LCALL latency.
 *
 * 3. The SPI clock is started when a transfer starts. It is not a
 *    global free-running clock.
 *
 * 4. The two-level FIFO queue does NOT include the actual I/O shift
 *    register, which is in a separate hardware register. In other
 *    words, it is possible to have up to two bytes queued, plus a
 *    third byte that is partially transmitted.
