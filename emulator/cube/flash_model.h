/*
 * This header holds all of the model-specific details for our flash
 * memory.  The intention is for flash.c to be as model-agnostic as
 * possible, so it's easier to switch to other NOR parts in the
 * future.
 *
 * Currently this is based on the SST39VF1681, but this likely isn't
 * what we'll actually be using in the final design.
 *
 * Our current requirements:
 *
 *  - NOR flash, 2Mx8 (16 megabits)
 *
 *  - Low power (Many memories have an automatic standby feature, which gives them
 *    fairly low power usage when we're clocking them slowly. Our actual clock rate
 *    will be 2.67 MHz peak.)
 *
 *  - Fast program times. The faster we can get the better, this will directly
 *    impact asset download times.
 *
 *  - Fast erase times. This is very important- we'd like to stream assets in the
 *    background, but during an erase we can't refresh the screen at all until the
 *    erase finishes. This is clearly very bad for interactivity, so flashes with
 *    erase times in the tens of milliseconds are much better than flashes that
 *    take half a second or longer to erase.
