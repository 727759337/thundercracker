     * cycle. Since basic blocks are indivisible in the binary translated firmware, the
     * side-effects from a single basic block always happen before the interrupt is
     * delivered. But we can "virtually preempt" the basic block by storing its remaining
     * mTickDelay, and coming back to it later after return.
