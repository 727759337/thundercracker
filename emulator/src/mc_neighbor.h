 * Simulated neighbor transmit for the MC.
 * This file contains simulation-only definitions.
 *
 * This does NOT run on the normal MC simulation thread! Updates come in from the UI
 * thread, and we run the hardware simulation on the cube thread, as we need to run our
 * transmit process in lockstep with the cube clock. As such, in a lot of ways this file
 * actually acts much more like it's part of the cube hardware model than the MC.
