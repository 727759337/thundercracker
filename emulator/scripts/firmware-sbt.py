# Simple static binary translator for our 8051 firmware. This is used
# to "bake in" a stable firmware image, so that it isn't necessary to
# have an actual cube firmware ROM in order to run the emulator.
#
# This is done to an extent for performance, but also really for code
# security. It's much, much harder to reverse engineer` a usable ROM
# image from the siftulator binary due to this transformation.
#
# Since we need some hints about basic blocks and data vs. code, we
# take the SDCC ".rst" files as input, rather than the raw hex file.
